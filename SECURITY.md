## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately:

- **Email**: wei-wz.zhou@broadcom.com
- **GitHub**: Open a [private security advisory](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-AVI/security/advisories/new)

Do **not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

## Security Design

### Credential Management

- AVI Controller passwords are stored exclusively in `~/.vmware-avi/.env` (never in `config.yaml`, never in code)
- `.env` file permissions are verified at startup (`chmod 600` required)
- No credentials are logged, echoed, or included in audit entries
- Each controller uses a separate environment variable following the pattern: `<CONTROLLER_NAME_UPPER>_PASSWORD`
- AKO operations require a valid `kubeconfig` — the file is read-only and never modified by this skill

### Dual-Mode Architecture

This skill operates in two modes with separate authentication:

1. **AVI Controller mode** — authenticates via avisdk to AVI/NSX ALB controllers using username/password from `.env`
2. **AKO Kubernetes mode** — authenticates via kubectl using the user's existing kubeconfig; no additional credentials required

### Destructive Operation Safeguards

All write operations pass through multiple safety layers:

1. **`@vmware_tool` decorator** — mandatory on every MCP tool; provides pre-checks, audit logging, data sanitization, and timeout control
2. **Double confirmation** — CLI destructive commands (`vs_toggle` disable, `pool_member_disable`, `ako_restart`, `ako_config_upgrade`, `ako_sync_force`) require two separate "Are you sure?" prompts
3. **`--dry-run` default** — `ako_config_upgrade` defaults to `--dry-run` mode; the caller must explicitly opt out to execute
4. **Audit logging** — every operation (read and write) is logged to `~/.vmware/audit.db` (SQLite WAL) with timestamp, user, target, operation, parameters, and result
5. **Policy engine** — `~/.vmware/rules.yaml` can deny operations by pattern, enforce maintenance windows, and set risk-level thresholds

### SSL/TLS Verification

- TLS certificate verification is **enabled by default** for both AVI Controller and Kubernetes API connections
- `disableSslCertValidation: true` exists solely for AVI Controllers using self-signed certificates in isolated lab/home environments
- In production, always use CA-signed certificates with full TLS verification

### Transitive Dependencies

- `vmware-policy` is the only transitive dependency auto-installed; it provides the `@vmware_tool` decorator and audit logging
- All other dependencies are standard Python packages (avisdk, Click, Rich, python-dotenv, kubernetes)
- No post-install scripts or background services are started during installation
- PyPI package name: `vmware-avi`

### Prompt Injection Protection

- All AVI-sourced content (virtual service names, pool member addresses, AKO status messages) is processed through `_sanitize()`
- Sanitization truncates to 500 characters and strips C0/C1 control characters
- Output is wrapped in boundary markers when consumed by LLM agents
