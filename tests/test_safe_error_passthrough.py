"""A teaching message the agent never sees is not a teaching message.

``_safe_error`` reduces unrecognised exceptions to ``"<Class>: operation
failed."`` so raw Controller text — which can carry credentials in URLs —
cannot leak. The allowlist it checks against was an enumeration, and an
enumeration drifts: ``OSError`` was missing from it, so the one exception
``config.py`` raises — the missing-password error, this family's most common
first-run failure — reached an MCP agent as ``OSError: operation failed.``

That message's entire remedy is the env var name it carries, so redacting it
left the agent with a failure it could not act on and no way to discover the
fix. The defect was invisible from the CLI, which prints the message in full,
and invisible to the error-quality eval, which reads the message at the raise
site rather than what survives the wrapper.

So the rule is the inverse of an enumeration: every exception this skill raises
on purpose passes through, and only genuinely unplanned ones are reduced.

Admitting ``OSError`` was the wrong shape for that rule. "Exceptions this skill
raises on purpose" is a property of *this skill*, and ``OSError`` is the base
class of nearly every failure the network stack raises on its own: TLS
verification, DNS resolution, and requests' own connection errors are all
subclasses, and they carry the certificate subject, the hostname, and the full
``scheme://host:port/path`` respectively. ``sanitize`` does not redact — it
strips control characters and truncates — so admitting the base class published
all of it. The narrow ``ConfigError`` says what was actually meant.
