"""Regression test: write commands surface auth/TLS teaching too.

Code review found that read commands (@cli_errors) translated auth failures
into a teaching message, but write commands (routed through _run_audited) did
not — an auth failure on `vs enable` gave a raw traceback. The fix wires the
shared `teach_and_exit` into `_run_audited`. This test pins both that the
teaching reaches write commands AND that the success-path audit still fires
(a dropped `else:` branch during the fix was caught here).
