"""`ako_config_diff` must preview what `ako_config_upgrade` actually does.

From the 2026-07-19 pre-release review. The two commands were presented as
preview-then-apply but answered different questions:

    diff:    helm diff upgrade <rel> <chart> -n <ns>
    upgrade: helm upgrade      <rel> <chart> -n <ns> --reuse-values

Without ``--reuse-values`` the diff renders the chart's defaults, so every
value the operator has customised shows up as a pending change and the preview
does not describe the upgrade. Neither command pinned a chart version either,
so an unpinned OCI reference resolved to whatever the registry tagged latest —
two runs could differ with no local change, and the diff could preview a
different chart than the upgrade then applied.
