"""A failed AVI tool must not look like a successful one.

Every MCP tool in this skill runs a CLI ops function and hands back whatever it
printed. The ops layer reports failure the way a CLI does — print a red message,
then ``raise SystemExit(1)`` — and ``_capture_output`` caught that exception and
discarded it. The red text came back as the tool's ordinary return value.

Nothing downstream could tell the two apart. A model asking for a Virtual
Service that does not exist received the string "Virtual Service 'web-01' not
found." as a *successful* result, which is issue #31's reported failure mode:
the agent reads it as a finding and reports it to the user as fact rather than
recognising a fault and retrying with a corrected name.

Unhandled exceptions had the opposite problem — a missing config file raised
``FileNotFoundError`` straight out of the tool with its raw text, which can
carry paths and connection detail.

These tests pin both directions: failures are unmistakable, successes are
untouched, and neither leaks raw exception text.
