## v1.5.18 (2026-05-02)

**Family alignment + tooling normalization** — no source changes in this skill.

- **dev:** Migrated `[project.optional-dependencies] dev` → `[dependency-groups] dev` (PEP 735) so `uv sync --group dev` works uniformly across the family. Canonical set: `pytest>=8.0,<10.0`, `pytest-cov`, `ruff`.
- **test:** New `tests/eval/regression/test_release_blockers.py` (5 evals) catches the v1.5.x release blockers — missing `mcp_server` in wheel, AST-detected unimported runtime names, Typer app load failure, module import errors. Run via `pytest tests/eval/regression/`.
- **align:** Family version bump to v1.5.18.

## v1.5.17 (2026-05-01)

**Family alignment** — no source changes in this skill.

This release tracks vmware-pilot v1.5.17 (new `investigate_alert` template + `review_workflow` MCP tool + `parallel_group` step type) and vmware-policy v1.5.17 (L5 pattern matcher integrated into `@vmware_tool`). Both work with the existing skill MCP surface unchanged.

- **align:** Family version bump to v1.5.17.

## v1.5.16 (2026-04-30)

**Enterprise Harness Engineering alignment** — adapted from the Linkloud × addxai framework articles ([part 1](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/hz4W7ILHJ1yz_pG0Z1xP-A), [part 2](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/F3qYbyB3S8oIqx-Y4BrWNQ)).

- **docs:** "Automation Level Reference" section in `references/capabilities.md` — every tool tagged L1-L5 per the EHE framework.
- **docs:** Common Workflows in `SKILL.md` rewritten with pre-flight judgment for pool drain (capacity check / persistence behavior / observability baseline), AKO failure-layer triage, and SSL expiry audit.
- **align:** Family version bump to v1.5.16.

## v1.5.15 (2026-04-29)

**UX improvements from real user feedback**

- **feat:** New top-level CLI subcommand `vmware-avi mcp` starts the MCP server. Single command after `uv tool install vmware-avi` — no more `uvx --from`, no PyPI re-resolve, no TLS-proxy issues.
- **feat:** Default `verify_ssl: true` on new targets (was `false`). AVI Controller with default self-signed certs requires explicit `verify_ssl: false` in `config.yaml`.
- **docs:** README, SKILL.md, setup-guide.md, and `examples/mcp-configs/*.json` switched to `command: "vmware-avi"`, `args: ["mcp"]`. uvx form moved to fallback with TLS-proxy troubleshooting note.
- **compat:** Legacy `vmware-avi-mcp` console script kept — existing user configs continue to work.

## v1.5.14 (2026-04-21)

**Bug fixes from code review by @yjs-2026 (follow-up)**

- **fix:** `ako_ingress.py` — TLS secret checks now distinguish 404 (not found) from other errors (network, auth) instead of treating all exceptions as "not found"
- **fix:** `ako_ingress.py` — backend service path now checks for None on `backend`, `service`, and `name` before accessing

## v1.5.13 (2026-04-21)

**Bug fixes from code review 2026-04-20**

- **fix:** `ako_sync.py` — sync diff now uses exact + suffix match instead of substring match, preventing false negatives (e.g. ingress "ing" no longer matches "staging")
- **fix:** `ako_config.py` / `ako_multi_cluster.py` — all 7 `subprocess.run()` calls now have explicit `timeout` (30s kubectl, 120s helm, 300s upgrade) to prevent indefinite hangs

## v1.5.12 (2026-04-17)

- Align with VMware skill family v1.5.12 (security & bug fixes from code review by @yjs-2026)

## v1.5.11 (2026-04-17)

- Fix: vs_analytics HTTP 404 — AVI 22.x requires POST for `/analytics/metrics/collection` with `metric_requests[]` array wrapping (PR #4, credit @timwangbc)
- Fix: vs_error_logs HTTP 400 "VirtualService ID required" — added `virtualservice` URL param for VS UUID (PR #5, credit @timwangbc)
- Fix: pool_list vs_filter returned 0 matches for K8S-managed VSes — switched to `/virtualservice-inventory` which exposes the real VS→pool graph including pool groups (PR #6, credit @timwangbc)
- Fix: se_health VS count always 0 on 22.x — reconstructed SE→VS mapping by inverting `vip_summary[].service_engine[]` from `/virtualservice-inventory` (PR #7, credit @timwangbc)
- Tests: added unit tests for analytics, error logs, pool discovery, and SE health (14 new test cases)
- Result: 12/12 non-AKO MCP tools now pass against AVI Controller 22.x

## v1.5.10 (2026-04-16)

- Security: bump python-multipart 0.0.22→0.0.26 (DoS via large multipart preamble/epilogue)
- Align with VMware skill family v1.5.10

## v1.5.8 (2026-04-15)

- Feat: MCP server migrated from low-level `mcp.server.Server` to `FastMCP`, matching the rest of the family. All 30 tool names and input schemas preserved.
- Fix: 4 destructive MCP tools bypassed CLI's interactive `double_confirm` in MCP mode. Added `confirmed: bool = False` parameter with preview-by-default: `vs_toggle` (when disabling), `pool_member_disable`, `ako_restart`, `ako_sync_force`. Ops-layer functions now take `skip_prompt` so MCP callers that already validated `confirmed=True` bypass the stdio-blocking prompt.
- Align with VMware skill family v1.5.8

## v1.5.7 (2026-04-15)

- Align with VMware skill family v1.5.7 (Pilot `__from_step_N__` fix + VKS SSL/timeout fix)

## v1.5.6 (2026-04-15)

- Fix: CRITICAL — `mcp_server` module missing from PyPI wheel due to missing hatch packages config. MCP server would fail with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp_server'`. Added `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel] packages = ["vmware_avi", "mcp_server"]` to pyproject.toml
- Fix: FQDN in controller host config — avisdk rejected non-IP hostnames with "Invalid Controller IP6 Address". Connection manager now resolves FQDN -> IP via socket.getaddrinfo() at connect time
- Fix: vs_analytics returned empty series — switched from per-entity endpoint to analytics/metrics/collection with entity_uuid for consistent results across Controller 22.x/30.x versions
- Fix: vs_error_logs HTTP 400 — duration field now parsed via shorthand helper (accepts '1h', '30m', '24h', '7d' or raw seconds) and sent as integer seconds to match API contract
- Feat: vs_status now returns VIP(s), Pool, PoolGroup, health (oper_status), reason, throughput, new conn/s, latency, and SE placement
- Feat: se_health VS count derived from multiple known runtime fields (se_vs_list, vs_ref) for accurate counts across Controller versions
- Feat: new pool_list MCP tool — discover pools on controller with optional vs_filter substring; solves "pool names differ from VS names" discovery gap

## v1.5.5 (2026-04-15)

- Align with VMware skill family v1.5.5

## v1.5.4 (2026-04-14)

- Security: bump pytest 9.0.2→9.0.3 (CVE-2025-71176, insecure tmpdir handling)

## v1.5.0 (2026-04-12)

### Anthropic Best Practices Integration

- **[READ]/[WRITE] tool prefixes**: All MCP tool descriptions now start with [READ] or [WRITE] to clearly indicate operation type
- **Read/write split counts**: SKILL.md MCP Tools section header shows exact read vs write tool counts
- **Negative routing**: Description frontmatter includes "Do NOT use when..." clause to prevent misrouting
- **Broadcom author attestation**: README.md, README-CN.md, and pyproject.toml include VMware by Broadcom author identity (wei-wz.zhou@broadcom.com) to resolve Snyk E005 brand warnings

### AVI-specific

- **Full tool description rewrite**: All 29 tool descriptions rewritten from 2-7 words to full When/What/Gotchas format with R/W column in SKILL.md

## v1.4.9 (2026-04-11)

- Fix: narrow AKO ingress trigger — only fire for Tanzu/vSphere AKO ingress, not generic nginx-ingress
- Fix: clarify vmware-policy compatibility field (Python transitive dep, not required standalone binary)

## v1.4.8 (2026-04-09)

- Security: bump cryptography 46.0.6→46.0.7 (CVE-2026-39892, buffer overflow)
- Security: bump urllib3 2.3.0→2.6.3 (multiple CVEs) [VMware-VKS]
- Security: bump requests 2.32.5→2.33.0 (medium CVE) [VMware-VKS]

## v1.4.7 (2026-04-08)

- Fix: align openclaw metadata with actual runtime requirements
- Fix: standardize audit log path to ~/.vmware/audit.db across all docs
- Fix: update credential env var docs to correct VMWARE_<TARGET>_PASSWORD convention
- Fix: declare .env config and vmware-policy optional dependency in metadata
